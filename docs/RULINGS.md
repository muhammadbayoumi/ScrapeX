# Rulings — what the owner has decided

Every decision the owner has made about ScrapeX, with the date, the reason, and
the evidence that produced it. Governed by **C3** and **C4** in
[../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md):

- A ruling is recorded here, not left in a commit message or a conversation.
- **A superseded ruling stays.** It is marked, it points to what replaced it, and
  it says what changed. The owner's view is expected to move as evidence
  arrives; the history of a decision is part of the decision.

Rulings are numbered `R-nn` in the order they were recorded. The number never
changes and is never reused.

> **Format.** Each entry states the ruling, the date, what he actually said where
> that is on record, and — where one exists — the measurement that decided it.

### R-01 · Diagnose, confirm, then fix — one step at a time
**2026-07-21 · process**

Explain the problem first, agree the cause, then solve it step by step. Not a fix
delivered on first contact.

> «عندى مشاكل عاوز اشرحها وبعد فهمها نحاول نحلها خطوة خطوة»

**Why:** he is the author and reasons about his own system. A fix landed before
the cause is agreed removes the evidence he needs to judge it. Prefer read-only
inspection while diagnosing — during one such session a plain `sqlite3.connect()`
created a stray `harvest.db` and destroyed the state being diagnosed.

**Apply:** present the proven root cause with `file:line` evidence, then ask
before editing.

### R-02 · An un-computable mapping is the owner's call, and studies come first
**2026-07-30 · process**

Where a correspondence cannot be computed from the source data, he decides — and
he may refuse to decide until the supporting facts are measured.

Asked where the `Bagged` packaging type belonged, he did not pick:

> «اريد فحص اكتر هل هناك فرق فى السعر ام لا … وكمان اريد دراسة وضع السعر الى اكتر
> من ٣٠ طن فى price trade … اريد دراسة الامرين»

**Apply:** offer options with the *measured* consequence of each. Answer a study
with counts from live data. Build everything that does not depend on the open
ruling, and leave the undecided fact flowing through the unrecognised-code path
so the question stays visible instead of being absorbed by a default. This is the
standing `ASK` rule in `scrapex/vocab.py`.

---

### R-03 · `Bagged` packaging is filed under **Store**
**2026-07-30 · data model · decided by R-02's studies**

Both studies came in first, and they are what decided it: the corporate site
publishes the same CEM II cement as available in bags *and* in bulk, and
packaging carries **no price signal at all** in that source. So packaging is how
the store supplies the goods, not a property of them — his own
Specifications / More-information / Store boundary, applied to evidence.

### R-04 · All ten web-only settings move into the extension
**2026-08-01 · scope**

Offered three options — move Excel and Sheets only, record an explicit exemption,
or move them all — he chose to move them all. He did **not** take the storage
exemption offered, so `backup_folder` moves too. Only `runtime-restart` and
`runtime-upgrade` stay exempt.

The ten: `excel_folder`, `excel_workbook`, `excel_schema`, `excel_structure`,
`excel_update`, `funnel_url`, `funnel_token`, `google_folder`, `google_workbook`,
`backup_folder` — saved from `templates/excel.html`, `templates/sync.html` and
`templates/_storage.html`, each POSTing `/api/settings`.

**Why:** his standing rule SR-10 says every setting lives in the extension, and
it was true for exactly one page. The guard read `templates/settings.html` and
nothing else, so ten settings sat outside a rule that looked enforced.

**Apply:** the guard is the deliverable, not just the move — it must read **every**
template under `scrapex/webui/templates/`, keeping the named runtime-repair
exemption. The web page must keep **displaying** every value it stops editing
(SR-10's second half).

### R-06 · `VERSION` moves with every merged pull request
**2026-08-16 · release · supersedes [R-05](#r-05--version-moves-per-user-visible-capability)**

`scrapex/version.py:VERSION` moves on **every new commit**. PRs are
squash-merged here, so one commit on `main` = one merged PR = one bump. Each bump
regenerates `contracts/capability-baseline.json` and `CHANGELOG.md` in the same
commit, and updates the `pyproject.toml` mirror.

**Why the old rule died:** "each user-visible capability" left the judgement to
whoever was writing, and they kept deciding no. Measured with
`git log -G'^VERSION = "'` — the number moved **three times in the project's
life**, last at `adf31b2` on 2026-08-10, then stood still for 48 commits covering
Phase A entire, T1 and B2. He noticed and said so. (As of 2026-08-17 the gap is
**58 commits**.)

> Use `-G`, not `-S`, on this file: `-S` finds only one of the three, because
> `0.2.1` → `0.2.2` leaves the count of the searched string unchanged.

**BLOCKED — do not simply bump it.** See [R-07](#r-07--the-engine-keeps-the-version-gate-and-drops-the-advert).

**Conflict — RESOLVED 2026-08-17.** [ENGINEERING.md](../ENGINEERING.md) **W4**
read *"ONE product version, and it moves when the behaviour does"* — the
superseded R-05 trigger — and was stale in a second, more dangerous way: it
called `extension/manifest.json` a **mirror** with a drift test, which
[R-07](#r-07--the-engine-keeps-the-version-gate-and-drops-the-advert) and PR #112
deliberately undid. Measured before rewriting: `pyproject.toml` really is an
enforced mirror (`tests/test_version.py:79`), while the manifest comparison was
removed on 2026-08-05 and `tests/test_version.py:536` now **fails if anyone
re-pins it**. A reader following the old W4 literally would have re-welded the
two numbers — the one thing this ruling forbids. W4 now states both correctly.

### R-07 · The engine keeps the version **gate** and drops the **advert**
**2026-08-16 · release · unblocks R-06**

`MINIMUM_EXTENSION_VERSION` is a fact the engine owns, derived from the ledger —
it **stays**. "What is the newest extension available" is Chrome's answer, not
the engine's — it **goes**, along with the two constants that still say the
engine carries the extension.

**The defect, found by trying the bump and reverting it the same day:**
`version_report` sends `"latest_extension_version": VERSION`
(`scrapex/version.py:483`, again in `scrapex/webui/app.py:1459`, drawn by
`extension/app.js:595` and `:629`). The moment the engine moves ahead of
`extension/manifest.json`, the panel draws *"This ScrapeX extension is older than
the engine it is talking to"*. Measured at 320×440: the profile page's legal line
went from 396 to 494 against a 440 viewport — 54px clipped. Under "bump every
commit" that card becomes **permanent and false**.

Also to go: `LATEST_SOURCE` (*"it ships with the extension"*, `:289`) and
`UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS` (*"it carries the new extension with it"*, `:292`).

**Never fix this by bumping `extension/manifest.json` alongside VERSION.** That
was recommended once and it was wrong: it re-welds exactly what PLATFORM-PLAN
Decision 21 unwelded (PR #112), whose "Done when" is *"the other number
untouched"*. The two ship down separate paths — Google reviews the extension,
nobody reviews the engine.

**Apply:** its own pull request, with a guard that fails if the engine ever
answers for the extension's head again.

### R-08 · The plan and the state live in the repository
**2026-08-15 · process · generalised by [R-09](#r-09--one-documentation-system-in-the-repository-all-english)**

The owner works from two machines. A plan on one of them does not exist on the
other. `docs/MIGRATION-PLAN.md` was moved out of `~/.claude/plans/` on this
ruling, and `docs/HANDOFF-resume-the-migration.md` was created as its living
state.

### R-09 · One documentation system, in the repository, all English
**2026-08-17 · process · generalises R-08**

> الرجوع اليه واى تغير منى يتم توثيقه حتى لو اختلف راى فراى ديناميكى يعدل ويطور
> مع الوقت»

**What forced it:** R-08 moved one plan and stopped there. On 2026-08-17 he opened
the second machine — a **different user account** — and could not continue. Two
things were true at once: thirteen memory files and seven plans lived under one
account's home directory, and the repository held no `CLAUDE.md` at all, so a
fresh session there had no pointer to the good documents that *were* committed.

**The system:** `CLAUDE.md` → `docs/STATE.md` → `docs/RULINGS.md` →
`docs/LESSONS.md` → `docs/plans/`. Its five governing rules are **C1–C5** in
[../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md).

### R-11 · A contractor directory is a separate table, and a table like any other
**2026-08-17 · data model**

Two statements, given at different moments, that together shaped PR #211:

> «جدول منفصل تماما عن جداول المنتجات» — a table entirely separate from the
> product tables.

> «صفحة المقاولين هى جدول سيظهر كاى جدول لدينا» — the contractors page is a table
> that will appear like any of our tables.

**Separate in storage, identical as a surface.** That framing is what made the
work small: `grid.js` never asks where a payload came from, so
`dataset_table_payload` fills the same keys from `generic_record` that
`reports.table_payload` fills from `price_observation`, and not one line of the
page changed.

---

### R-12 · One row, with a button that flips it
**2026-08-17 · UI**

> «فى النهاية اريد رؤوية جدول اقدر ابدل بين عربى وانجليزى»

The Arabic and English halves land in **one** row, merged **by contractor id,
never by position** — the listing reorders every thirty seconds (measured: 4,556
of 11,059 contractors appeared on more than one page in a single pass), so
zipping two pages row-by-row would attach one company's Arabic name to another's
English one and look perfectly reasonable on screen.

### R-13 · Sign out of all accounts must really sign out all of them
**2026-08-16 · extension**

`Sign out of all accounts` pressed the top `#signout`, which revokes only the
current account's grant; every other account kept the standing Google grant that
makes a silent mint succeed. The ruling: a real sign-out — mint a token for each
other account silently (`login_hint` + `prompt=none`), revoke **that** token, and
press `#signout` last, because signing out the current account clears
`state.token`.

**The lockout it would otherwise have been:** the panel holds exactly one token
and it belongs to the *current* account. Handing `state.token` to `revokeToken`
ends the wrong grant — press Sign out on somebody else's row and be signed out of
your own. Guarded by `tests/test_signing_out_really_signs_out.py`.

### R-14 · Requests are captured when made, then planned, then executed
**2026-08-17 · process**

> «كل طلب او اضافة او اى شى اذكره ونقرر انه فى المستقبل نحطه … علشان مننساش، ولما
> نوصله نعمله خطه ونفذها» · «عاوز ادارة لطلباتى بحيث توثق وتحفظ ومنها نعمل خطة
> ومنها ننفذ الخطة»

Every request goes into [REQUESTS.md](REQUESTS.md) as `REQ-nn` in the session it
is made, quoted in his own words, and moves **Captured → Ruled → Planned → In
flight → Done**. Done and dropped requests are kept, never deleted.

**Why, with the evidence:** [R-04](#r-04--all-ten-web-only-settings-move-into-the-extension)
was ruled on 2026-08-01, after he was offered three options and chose the most
thorough. Sixteen days later nothing had been built and it had dropped out of
sight entirely — it survived only because a memory file happened to mention SR-10.

**He asked whether `CHECKLIST` was the right name, and it was not.** A checklist is
ticked and discarded: no state, no evidence, no history. What he described is a
five-state pipeline. `REQUESTS.md` was recommended and adopted; `ROADMAP` was
rejected for promising an order he has not set.

**And the boundary rule that came with it**, because building it exposed a
duplication: **he asked → `REQUESTS.md`; we found it → `BACKLOG.md`; a decision
was taken → `RULINGS.md`.** See
[REQ-09](REQUESTS.md#req-09--one-home-for-rulings-not-two) — this file was written
without reading `BACKLOG.md`, which had held 23 standing rules since 2026-07-29.
**He ruled on that on 2026-08-19:** the `SR-` rules moved here
([R-16](#r-16--one-home-for-rulings-and-it-is-this-file)).

### R-15 · The documents are guarded by a test, not by good intentions

**2026-08-19 · active · [REQ-08](REQUESTS.md#req-08--a-guard-against-the-documents-going-stale)**

> «نفذ توصيتك فى REQ-08 و REQ-09» — *carry out your recommendation on REQ-08 and
> REQ-09.*

He was offered three options and took the recommendation: **(b)** — a test that
every `file:line` citation in the system's documents still points at the symbol
quoted beside it. Not (a), which would have made the prose machine-generated, and
not (c), which was **C2** and good intentions.

**What decided it was not an argument, it was three failures.** Re-reading
`STATE.md` two days after it was written found the `"latest_extension_version"`
citation in `scrapex/webui/app.py` still pointing at line 1355 when the code had
moved to 1375 — #211 and #212 inserted twenty lines above it — and
`LATEST_SOURCE`/`UPDATE_INSTRUCTIONS` cited at lines 289 and 292 when they had
been at 282 and 285 all along, in a file no commit had touched. A citation that
silently moves is worse than no citation: it sends the next session to the wrong
line with full confidence.

**The scope is the map in [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md), and the exclusion is
deliberate.** The guard reads the documents C1 tells every session to read.
`docs/plans/` is **excluded**: those are verbatim historical records, and
[plans/README.md](plans/README.md) says nothing in them was rewritten, *"because a
plan edited after the fact stops being evidence of what was decided when"*. A plan
from 2026-07-20 citing `reports.py:176` described that day's code correctly.
Forcing it to match today's would be falsifying a record to make a test pass.

Enforced by `tests/test_the_documents_cite_what_they_claim.py`.

### R-16 · One home for rulings, and it is this file

**2026-08-19 · active · [REQ-09](REQUESTS.md#req-09--one-home-for-rulings-not-two)**

Recommendation **(a)**, taken: `SR-1`–`SR-23` move out of `BACKLOG.md` §1 and into
this file, each keeping its number. `BACKLOG.md` §1 becomes a pointer, and that file
keeps what it is genuinely best at — `OP-`, `DEC-`, `BV-`, `DEBT-`, `Q-`.

**The defect was mine, and it is recorded rather than quietly repaired.** This file
was written on 2026-08-17 without reading `BACKLOG.md`, which had held 23 standing
rules since 2026-07-29 and called itself *"the one tracking document"*. His rulings
then lived in two registers — barely overlapping in content, completely overlapping
in kind. That is the same defect the migration plan warns about at B2 step 2: *"do
not write a second one."*

Option (b) — folding `R-01`–`R-14` back into BACKLOG.md — was rejected because
**C1** requires every session to read the rulings before designing anything, and a
1,151-line document does not get read before every design decision. Option (c), a
documented split by subject, was rejected because a boundary nobody can state in
one sentence will not hold.

### R-17 · A fix is adversarially reviewed before it is written
**2026-08-20 · process**

> «مراجعة عدائية اولا على 3 اصلاحات»

Three drifts had been reported and he asked for them to be **attacked** before
being written — not checked, refuted. Then «نفذ».

**It earned its keep on the first pass, against the reviewer's own findings:**

| the review did | to what |
|---|---|
| **refuted one** | "`RULINGS.md` says 58 commits and the truth is 64" — the line reads *"(As of 2026-08-17 the gap is 58 commits.)"*. Dated, therefore history. The finding was withdrawn |
| **widened another** | "16 days" had a second copy in `STATE.md` and a third spelled out as "sixteen days ago" |
| **replaced the remedy** | fixing `STATE.md`'s "#215 in flight" was a symptom; #215 had merged eighteen hours *before* the PR carrying that sentence, so the sentence reached `main` already false |
| **found three the fixes had missed** | the board has no generator, so it must drift; `REQ-05` read `Done` while O-1..O-4 stayed open; and the pipeline's *"may not skip one"* was obeyed by **no entry at all** |

**And it works against an implementation too, which is the part worth keeping.**
The rule that came out of the review — *no elapsed durations* — was then written
over the registers' free prose, run, and **withdrawn**: it flagged twelve lines and
essentially every one was honest history ("no one noticed for eleven days",
"Sixteen days later nothing had been built"). A closed past interval does not rot;
an open count against today does; no regex over prose separates them. The rule
now lives on the parsed state fields, where it is exact. See
[LESSONS.md](LESSONS.md) and [REQ-10](REQUESTS.md#req-10--adversarially-review-the-fixes-then-execute).

**How to apply.** Attack each proposed fix on three questions before writing it:
*is the finding even true*, *is the scope right in both directions*, and *does the
fix address the cause or the symptom*. [APPROACHES.md](APPROACHES.md) **A5** is the
method; this ruling makes it the default for a fix rather than an option, and the
limit is stated there too — a review by the same author who proposed the fix is
weaker than independent critics, and finding five things is evidence it worked, not
proof it was enough.

## Standing rules — the data, product and process policy (`SR-1`–`SR-23`)

**Migrated here from [BACKLOG.md](BACKLOG.md) §1 on 2026-08-19, on the owner's
ruling ([R-16](#r-16--one-home-for-rulings-and-it-is-this-file)).** Every number is
unchanged: `SR-7` is still `SR-7` everywhere it is cited. The table is moved
**verbatim** — not one of his words was rewritten in the move, because a ruling
paraphrased is a ruling weakened.

They stay `SR-` rather than becoming `R-` for the same reason: an ID cited across
eleven documents and two test suites is renumbered only by someone who wants to
break every citation at once. **Two prefixes, one home** — and the home is the file
**C1** sends every session to read.

`SR-` rules are his settled *policy*: what may be collected, what may never be
edited, how a price behaves, how work is committed. `R-` rules are the *decisions*
he has taken, dated, each with the evidence that produced it. Re-proposing an `SR-`
rule wastes a session.

| ID | Rule | Why | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| **SR-1** | **Source truth is never edited.** What the site publishes is the record, typos included. Rules decide *where* a fact is shown, never *what* it says. | A cleaning rule silently forks the warehouse from the source; the next crawl can no longer tell "the shop fixed it" from "our rule stopped firing". | Owner 2026-07-28: «مصدر الحقيقة هو ما ينشره الموقع حتى لو كان فيه خطأ بشرى… القواعد فقط لمعلومة تُعرض أين، ولكن لا لتغييرها» — *the source of truth is what the site publishes even if it contains a human error; rules only decide where a fact is shown, never change it.* memory `source-truth-never-edited.md` |
| **SR-2** | **Bilingual capture.** Anything a site publishes in AR *and* EN is captured in both — names, category levels, attribute labels *and* values, descriptions, units. A missing translation the site does publish is a **defect**, not a nicety. | The owner reads and reports in both languages and refuses to re-extract to see the other one. | Owner 2026-07-23: «أى محتوى أجيبه من أى موقع متوفر باللغة الإنجليزية والعربية أريد أن أجيبه باللغتين» — *any content available in both English and Arabic, I want in both.* memory `bilingual-capture-rule.md` |
| **SR-3** | **A price is never converted.** A converted number is never shown without the rate that produced it *and* that rate's date. Google Finance is the rate authority. | The one time this was broken it put 3,312 figures in the warehouse that no page had ever printed. | Owner 2026-07-26; `scrapex/config.py:74`, `scrapex/rates.py:5`, `grid.js:1382` |
| **SR-4** | **Authority first, then recency, for exchange rates.** A rate *provider* always outranks a shop's own published rate; among providers the newest wins. A shop's rate is still used where no provider published one. | advancedcastle publishes a SAR/EGP ratio of 13.46 while pricing its own Egyptian pages at 11.768. On recency alone that number would have converted every EGP-priced row in the warehouse. | `69e986c`, migration `0054` |
| **SR-5** | **Retention never deletes a price observation.** Space is reclaimed by *building* a new database and switching a pointer; the predecessor is sealed beside it and never removed. The UI may never say "recovered space" (a test fails if that phrase appears). | Observations can never be re-observed. | memory `scrapex-phase5-integrations.md`; append-only enforced by SQLite triggers (ENGINEERING A7) |
| **SR-6** | **An unchanged price is confirmed, not appended.** History is a timeline of real changes. Availability and stock have no history at all — latest state only. | A year of unchanged diesel used to be 52 identical "history" rows. | memory `scrapex-price-semantics.md` |
| **SR-7** | **Development beats crawling.** A migration blocked by a running crawl → pause the crawl (never cancel), back up, apply via `init-db`, restart, resume. Do not ask again. | A crawl is repeatable and resumable; a half-applied change is not. | Owner 2026-07-29: «وقف الزحفة … التطوير اهم من الزحف» — *stop the crawl; development matters more than crawling.* memory `development-beats-crawling.md` |
| **SR-8** | **robots.txt: `Crawl-delay` honoured automatically; `Disallow` NEVER enforced and never a warning** — one info-level job-log line only where a disallowed path intersects one we crawl. | The owner wants uninterrupted crawling, but wants a future block to have a traceable cause. | Owner 2026-07-22, `docs/robots-policy.md` |
| **SR-9** | **Silence is never permission to go faster.** Absent config reads as *honour the delay* at every layer. Turning it off announces the number it is overriding. | A crawler that outpaces a site by default gets its owner blocked without him choosing it. | `c63ec21` |
| **SR-10** | **Every setting lives in the extension; the web page is display-only** — but display-only is not blank: the page must still show every value it stopped editing. | A setting that exists only on the web page is a setting the owner does not have — proven: crawl pace was built, plumbed to `HttpFetcher`, and he asked for it as if it did not exist. | Owner 2026-07-29: «لا اريد اى اعدادت على صفحة الويب الاعدادت كلها على extension بينما صفحة الويب للعرض فقط». Enforced by `tests/test_settings_live_in_the_extension.py` (`2253308`), not by memory |
| **SR-11** | **Delete is two actions, never one.** *Stop tracking* keeps every row ever collected; *Erase collected data* keeps the registration. Both confirmed by typing, not by an OK. | Removing an entry is not a claim that none of the data happened. | Owner 2026-07-28, `412785b` |
| **SR-12** | **A rename moves the data with the name** — all nine tables in ONE transaction, manifest rewritten only after the rows have moved. | Renaming the manifest alone would not rename a source, it would orphan one. | `412785b`, `scrapex/sources_admin.py:11` |
| **SR-13** | **Nothing is collected that is not declared in `sources.yaml`.** The manifest is an extraction contract with a scope guard that rejects out-of-contract rows. | Owner principle: «له أساس ليس جمعاً عشوائياً» — *it has a basis, it is not random collection.* | `sources.yaml:1-18` |
| **SR-14** | **GPP: the latest published price only, never their paid historical series.** Our history accumulates from our own weekly observations. | A licence obligation, and it is tested (ENGINEERING T6). | `sources.yaml:436`, memory `scraper-ecosystem-design.md` |
| **SR-15** | **Names state their language: unmarked = English, `_ar` = Arabic; the key and the label are the same word.** A monolingual Arabic source fills `product_name_ar` and leaves `product_name` **empty** — never "helpfully" carry Arabic into the unmarked column. | The reader had to learn a private vocabulary to use his own spreadsheet. | `docs/column-vocabulary.md`, migrations `0038`–`0042`, `PAYLOAD_VERSION 2` |
| **SR-16** | **Column presence is per source.** Every gate in `reports.column_presence` asks *this* source's own rows, never a global table. | A global `currency_rate` count once put fuel-implied USD estimates on every shop. | memory `scrapex-columns-classification.md` |
| **SR-17** | **Detail groups are a closed vocabulary of seven, and a code the map has never seen goes to the owner before it gets a group.** | A silently widened catch-all misinforms every later reader. | Owner 2026-07-28, migration `0046`, `scrapex/vocab.py` `_DETAIL_GROUP_BY_CODE` |
| **SR-18** | **Commit and push after each plan step; do not batch, and do not end a step asking "shall I continue?".** | The owner works across parallel sessions and worktrees; unpushed commits are invisible to them — that is how a duplicate `0012` migration happened. | Owner, repeated. memory `commit-and-push-each-step.md` |
| **SR-19** | **Never `git add .` or stage a path list — read the whole cached diff before committing.** | Twice this swept another session's half-finished work into a commit and broke `main` from a clean checkout. | `e2573e1` ("I staged that file after reading only `--stat`. Reading the whole cached diff is the rule that would have caught it, and it is the rule I agreed to"), `0a2209c` |

### R-18 · Merge it when it is green

**2026-08-20 · process**

> «ادمج لما يخضر»

Said while four pull requests sat waiting on checks that had only just started
working again. It ends a standing ambiguity: before this, green was reported to him
and each merge waited for a separate instruction, which meant a ready pull request
could sit for a day for no reason anyone could name.

**Green means the checks that ran, not the checks that exist.** Three things had to
be settled before this ruling could be safely obeyed, and all three are why it is
written down rather than assumed:

| trap | what it means for this rule |
|---|---|
| **`main` has no branch protection at all** — `gh api .../branches/main/protection` answers 404 | Nothing mechanical stops a red merge. This ruling is the whole gate, so it has to be read literally |
| **A run that never started reports failure** | The 2026-08-19 outage failed every job with *"the job was not started because recent account payments have failed"* and no step executed. That is not red, it is absent — read the annotation before believing a failure |
| **A green tick can belong to a different tree** | #217's `pull_request` run passed while its `push` run failed on the same commit: the merge ref carried `main`'s revert, the branch alone did not. A tick from before the last rebase is evidence about a tree nobody is merging |

**How to apply.** When every check on a pull request has *concluded* and every
conclusion is success, merge it — squash, and no further instruction needed. Do not
merge while anything is `IN_PROGRESS`, `SKIPPED` or `QUEUED`; a skipped required
check reads as satisfied, which is the silent-skip failure this repository has now
recorded three times. If a check is red, establish whether it ran at all before
touching the code. And if the branch has been rebased since the tick, wait for the
new run — the old one described a tree that no longer exists.

This does not override the ordering a stack imposes: a pull request whose premise is
another's still waits for it, green or not.

### R-19 · The five multi-valued contractor groups go in CHILD TABLES, not JSON

**2026-08-20 · data model · answers [O-1](#open--awaiting-the-owners-ruling)**

> «جداول أبناء للخمس كلّها»

Interests, Licensed Activities, Qualification Programs, Balady Services and the
contractor relations each get a real child table. Not a JSON blob inside
`data_json`.

**AND THIS OVERRULES THE DESIGN DOCUMENT, which is why it is written here rather
than quietly applied.** [CONTRACTOR-SOURCE.md](CONTRACTOR-SOURCE.md) states flatly
that the five hierarchical groups go in JSON inside `data_json`. He was offered
that, with JSON as the recommendation, and chose child tables. The document is
corrected in the same pull request as this ruling — **C2** — and its previous
position is left visible rather than deleted, per **C4**.

**HE ASKED WHETHER HIS OWN DECISION WAS WRONG — «ربما يكون قرار خاطى» — so it was
measured rather than deferred to, and the measurement supports him.**

One real profile was fetched and parsed (شركة عبر المملكة سبك, membership 10001274,
the contractor whose absence from the warehouse started this):

| group | what the page actually holds |
|---|---|
| Interests / activities | **30 values across 6 groups, and they are HIERARCHICAL** — a parent category with children: building construction 6, roads 4, electrical 5, lifts 5, landscaping 7, sewage 3 |
| Licensed activities | a table with **one row — the header only.** Empty for this contractor |
| Main / sub contractors | two tables, **one row each.** Empty, which agrees with the card counts: `0` for 11,057 of 11,059 records |

**So the arithmetic is roughly 30 hierarchical values x 17,283 contractors — about
half a million rows.** In an indexed child table that is nothing for SQLite and it
answers *"which contractors operate sewage networks"* instantly. As JSON it stores
just as easily but the same question means scanning eleven thousand blobs.

**AND THE ARGUMENT MADE FOR JSON DID NOT ACTUALLY DISTINGUISH THE TWO.** The
recommendation leaned on the grid being one flat table — but the grid cannot render
a nested JSON array either. Both shapes need new payload work; only one of them
also gives the query. The design picked JSON before anyone had counted those thirty
values.

**The limit of this evidence, stated plainly: one contractor.** Generalising needs a
handful more profiles, which the crawl study will produce. But the direction is
unambiguous and nothing in it favours JSON.

> **MEASURED 2026-08-21, at his instruction to test this ruling before building it.**

**What it costs.** Five tables and their migration; a read path per table; and the
dataset payload has to carry them, which today it cannot. That last part is the real
work and it is not yet designed — and it would have been needed for JSON too.

**What is already true and helps.** `dataset_relationship` and
`relationship_field_pair` exist (`db/migrations/0013_generic_dataset_catalog.sql`),
with a propose/list API and tests. They hold **0 rows**. So the machinery for the
relations half exists and has never had a tenant.

### R-20 · An unchanged contractor is confirmed, not re-recorded

**2026-08-20 · data model · answers [O-3](#open--awaiting-the-owners-ruling) and [O-4](#open--awaiting-the-owners-ruling)**

> «مراجعة عند التغير فقط»

A second crawl that finds a contractor unchanged **updates `last_seen_at` and
writes no revision**. History is kept — a revision per real change, which is what
makes "when did this classification change" answerable.

**This is `SR-6` applied to a directory instead of a price** — *"an unchanged price
is confirmed, not appended"* — and the reasoning transfers exactly: history is a
timeline of real changes, and a year of identical rows is not history.

**MEASURED, AND IT IS NOT WHAT THE CODE DOES TODAY.** `content_hash` exists on
`generic_record` and is **not consulted on ingest**: the warehouse holds **34,550
revisions for 11,059 contractors** — roughly three apiece, from two crawls of a
directory that barely changed. Under this ruling that number should have been close
to 11,059. So the ruling is a change to the write path, not a description of it.

**And it compounds with the storage question.** Every re-crawl currently grows the
revision table linearly whether anything changed or not, which is part of the
volume [DEC-9](BACKLOG.md) is arguing about. Consulting the hash is the cheapest
line in that argument.

### R-21 · One source owns every outbound request, and paces itself per site and per connection

**2026-08-20 · architecture**

> «التوازى يجب ان يكون مصدر واحد يدير اى استعلام او اتصال بالانترنت ويوازى على حسب
> سرعة الانترنت وسرعة الاستجابة من كل موقع… مواقع تقبل 10 طلبات ومواقع لا تقبل سوى
> طلب واحد وسرعة الانترنت تستحمل طلبان فقط»

Every outbound request goes through **one** component. It decides how many may be
in flight, adapting on two axes at once: **what each site tolerates**, learned per
host, and **what the local connection can carry**, measured.

**HALF OF THIS IS ALREADY BUILT, AND NONE OF IT IS USED.**
[scrapex/pacegovernor.py](../scrapex/pacegovernor.py) already keeps a `HostPace`
per host — *"one per host, never shared"* — carrying a `concurrency` that starts at
1 and is raised toward a ceiling of 4 only while the host stays clean. It learns
the uncontended latency at concurrency 1 and only there, and it carries the Scrapy
one-way ratchet from #210.

**But `grep` for `concurrency(` outside that file returns nothing, and the only
code that constructs a `PaceGovernor` is its own test suite.** The governor
computes a number no crawl reads.

**So the work this ruling names is not building a governor. It is three things:**

1. **Wire the existing governor into the fetch loop** — the crawl is sequential by
   construction today, so nothing consumes the learned concurrency.
2. **Add the global cap he asked for**, which does not exist: the governor is
   per-host and nothing bounds the *total* in flight by measured local bandwidth.
   Two sites at 4 each is 8 in flight on a connection that may carry 2.
3. **Make it the single owner.** Outbound requests are issued from more than one
   place today; this ruling makes that a defect.

**The measurement that justifies it**, recorded in the governor's own header from
2026-08-16 against muqawil.org: a page costs **5.84s, of which 5.69s is the server
thinking**. Compression was already on, HTTP/2 changed nothing, there is no `ETag`
— **nothing client-side touches the cost**. Four in flight took **9.5s where four
in series took 26.4s: a 2.8x gain**, every answer a 200.

**And the price, which is why the cap is per-site and adaptive rather than a
constant:** per-request latency rose from ~6.6s to ~9.2s under those four, a 40%
rise, with no 429 and no refused connection. The file's own words: *"That is a
server saying it is hurting in the only language it has"* — and a crawler that
waits for a 429 before easing off has ignored the polite warning to wait for the
rude one.


### R-22 · The full suite finishes before the pull request opens

**2026-08-20 · process**

> «لا بعد ان تنتهى» — then «حافظ على المبدا»

A pull request is opened after `python -m pytest -q` has **finished**, not while it
is running. Not at 24%, not at 48%, however clean the output looks so far.

**RECORDED BECAUSE I BROKE IT FIVE MINUTES AFTER SAYING IT MYSELF.** On this very
branch I wrote *"أفتح PR بعد أن تنتهي السويت — لا قبلها هذه المرّة"* and then opened
#227 at 48%. He corrected it, and let that one stand — «طالما فتحت خلاص هذه المرة» —
which is exactly why the rule goes in a file rather than in my intention. A practice
I could not keep for five minutes is not a practice.

**And it is not fussiness. It failed three times in one day:**

| | |
|---|---|
| #221 | opened on `tests/test_features.py` alone, six green. The full suite found **four** other things asserting on the feature manifest |
| #217 | the panel suite was run without the guard that watches the *shape* of the suite — the extension gate caught a missing mark after the PR was open |
| #216 | its own new docs gate failed on a file that had landed on `main` in #219, found only by running everything |

Each was found **after** the pull request existed, which is the expensive order: a red
PR is a claim already published.

**How to apply.** Run the suite, read its last line, then open. A slow suite is not a
reason to skip this — it is the reason **`OP-19`** is known to be a flake rather than
suspected of being one, and the reason the 2,656-test run is worth having at all. If
the wait is genuinely blocking, open it as a **draft** and mark it ready when the run
lands; that is what happened here after the fact, and it is the right shape done in
the right order.

### R-23 · ScrapeX is a multi-user product, so a warehouse is per installation

**2026-08-20 · architecture, and it corrects a framing of mine**

> «هو فعلا غير موجود ولكن الاداة مصممة انها تعمل لكذا مستخدم وليس لمستخدم واحد فقط
> اذا سنشغل crawl لهذا الجهاز — المقارنة ان تمت ستكون للتطوير وليس للجمع»

**The question he was answering.** The home machine has no engine database and a
pre-collapse pointer, so the 11,059 rows, the 1,728 snapshots and the sweep's
17,283-id sighting ledger existed on the work machine only. I put it to him as
[O-6](#open--awaiting-the-owners-ruling) — carry the file across, run only where the
data is, or keep two warehouses and reconcile them — and recommended the first two.

**His ruling is none of the three, because the premise was wrong.** ScrapeX is a
tool **many people install**, not one installation that happens to live on two
machines. Every user's warehouse is their own and starts empty; a machine with no
database is therefore the **normal first-run state of the product**, not a fault to
be repaired by copying a file. So: create a warehouse here and run the crawl into it.

**What this changes, and it is more than where a command runs:**

- **A coverage number is a fact about ONE installation.** "11,059 of 17,403" is not a
  project-wide truth and must never be written as one. The claim
  `docs/BACKLOG.md` DEC-11 already insists on — *"every contractor findable in the
  muqawil.org listing as of «timestamp»"* — needs *"in this installation"* beside it.
- **Comparing two machines' data is a DEVELOPMENT activity**, «للتطوير وليس للجمع».
  It can validate that the method is reproducible — two installations crawling the
  same live listing should converge on the same ids — and it is not a way of
  assembling one larger dataset.
- **`OP-22`'s framing was mine and it was wrong.** I called it "`CLAUDE.md`'s founding
  failure in the one place the repository cannot follow it". The repository rule is
  about **decisions and knowledge**, which do travel and are committed; a user's
  collected DATA was never meant to. Kept and corrected rather than deleted, per
  **C4/C5**.
- **What still travels is the code and the method.** A crawl that could only be run
  on the machine that happened to hold the data was a defect regardless — which is
  why `tools/crawl_muqawil_listing.py` had to exist either way.

**How to apply.** On an installation with no warehouse, create one — `scrapex
carry-over` where a pre-collapse pointer names old files (it opens them read-only,
verifies row counts, and rewrites the pointer only if they match), `scrapex init-db`
where there is nothing to carry. Then crawl. Do **not** copy another installation's
database in order to make a number match.

### R-24 · A database is UPGRADED, never replaced — the user's data survives the schema

**2026-08-20 · architecture. He is correcting something I did, and the correction is
the more important half of the ruling.**

> «انت ليه عملت قاعدة بيانات جديدة؟ فاعدة البيانات الى كانت موجودة قديمة كان ممكن
> تسال تطورها لتطابق تطوير الكود او تحذفها وتنشى واحده جديدة مطابقة لاخر نسخة من
> الكود. طبعا الافضل تطويرها لان عند نشر الاداة المفروض نحافظ على بيانات المستخدمين
> وقاعدة البيانات تتطور ويظل بياناتهم محفوظة»

**What I did.** [R-23](#r-23--scrapex-is-a-multi-user-product-so-a-warehouse-is-per-installation)
said to create a warehouse on this installation. `scrapex carry-over` refused —
[OP-23](BACKLOG.md) — so I set `SCRAPEX_DATA_ROOT` to a second location, ran
`init-db`, and crawled into that. His 3,739 price observations stayed behind a
pointer nothing opens, with an empty database beside them.

**`registry.py` says not to do that, in words, and I had quoted those words an hour
earlier:** *"NOT `init-db`… On an installation with data in them it produces an empty
warehouse beside a full one that nothing will open again."* A different data root
does not change the outcome; it only moves where the empty file sits.

**The ruling.** Two options existed — upgrade the old database so it matches the
code, or delete it and create a new one — and **upgrading is the one that ships**:
when the tool is published, a user's data must survive the schema evolving. That
makes the migration path a **product feature**, not maintenance. Concretely:

- **A carry-over or migration that refuses on real data is a release blocker**, not a
  backlog entry to route around. Routing around it is how it stays broken, because
  the only installations that exercise it are real ones.
- **Never create a second warehouse to get past a failing upgrade.** Fix the upgrade.
  If it truly cannot be fixed in the moment, stop and say so rather than leaving two
  databases and choosing the empty one.
- **`init-db` is for an installation with nothing to lose.** Everywhere else it is the
  trap `registry.py` names.
- **A value the upgrade supplies is reported**, and is reused from the migration that
  introduced the column rather than invented (see `Backfill` in
  `scrapex/databases/carry_over.py`). Inventing one would put a fact in the user's
  data that their source never said.

**Done under it, 2026-08-20:** `carry_over` fixed and the real installation upgraded
in place — 3,739 offers, 3,739 observations, 17,111 attributes, 7,410 change events,
**not one row short**, the 261 pre-0058 offers marked `legacy_unwitnessed`, the 3,478
without a unit untouched, and the old files still where they were, read-only.
Guarded by `tests/test_a_carry_over_upgrades_rather_than_starting_over.py`, six
mutations killed.

### R-25 · The crawl method is settled first; the schema and retention questions come last

**2026-08-21 · sequencing, and it decides what several open questions are waiting for**

> «صعب حسم هذا الامر الان سنتركه النهاية بعد معالجة كل مشاكل مقاول والاستقرار على
> افضل طرق ومسارت عمل crawl الخاصة به»

**What he was asked.** Two decisions were put to him together: which route
[OP-25](BACKLOG.md) should take (the parser's schema had refused 823 of 897 pages),
and `STORAGE.md` §5 — is a snapshot evidence or only a parse cache. He declined to
settle either **now**, and gave the order instead: finish muqawil's problems and
settle **the best methods and work-paths for its crawl**, then decide these.

**And the sequencing is right for a reason worth writing down.** Both deferred
questions are about **interpreting** stored pages; neither changes what is on disk.
`docs/GENERIC-FETCH-SEAM.md`'s central rule is that one page in gives one snapshot
out, unparsed, so interpretation can be re-run against the evidence at any time. That
was demonstrated twice on 2026-08-21: the 897 stored page-pairs were re-interpreted
**from disk, twice, with not one network request** — a wrong schema cost 20 minutes
where a re-crawl is two hours. So deferring an interpretation decision costs nothing,
while deferring a **collection** decision costs a re-crawl. Collection first is the
cheaper order, not merely the one he chose.

**How to apply.** Until he settles them:

- **Do not force either question to be answered by a default.** OP-25's three routes
  and §5's two readings stay open and stay written down.
- **Coverage stays at whatever the current schema admits** — 1,172 records tonight —
  and that number must be reported as *"limited by an unresolved schema decision"*
  rather than as the crawl's coverage. The crawl's own result is the **13,727 sighted
  ids and 1,982 stored pages**, which is complete and independent of it.
- **Work the crawl:** the 3,690 deficit, the counting proof, the `city_id`
  subdivision, per-cell re-sizing. That is what "أفضل طرق ومسارات عمل crawl" names.
- Anything needed by **all** routes may still be built — the `CARD_FIELDS`
  declaration is, because none of the three routes works without it.

### R-26 · The residual crawl runs in the background while development continues, and must be stoppable

**2026-08-21 · process, and it settles a cost question I had put to him**

> «لا مشكلة من تشغيل الزحف فى الخلفية أثناء التطوير وكلما يعود بنتيجة نفحصها ونطور
> اكتر المهم يكون قابل للايقاف والاستكمال»

I priced closing the 3,690 deficit at **~8,000 requests and about 5.5 hours** and put
it to him as a cost decision — close it all, or only the cheap part. He declined the
framing: **run it in the background while development continues**, examine each result
as it comes back, and keep improving. The condition is the whole ruling: **stoppable
and resumable.**

**What that requires, and it is not automatic:**

- **Stoppable at any moment without losing what it read.** `snapshotcrawl` commits
  every page as it arrives and `crawl_partition` writes sightings per attempt, so a
  killed crawl keeps every page and every id it saw. That much is already true and was
  demonstrated on 2026-08-20, when a crawl stopped after six cells kept all six.
- **Resumable without paying for what is on disk.** The same `--run-ref` again skips
  the pages that ref already stored and reads their ids back off the evidence rather
  than off the wire. **Sizing is NOT resumable** — a resumed run re-pays ~112 requests,
  about 5.7% of a full pass. That is stated rather than hidden, and `--plan` exists so
  it can be paid deliberately.
- **Restartable in pieces**, which is what makes "examine each result and improve"
  possible at all: a crawl that can only run all 56 cells re-reads 47 proven ones to
  reach the 9 that are not. The residual has to be addressable on its own.

**How to apply.** A long crawl is started detached, never inside a tool call that can
time out — the 10-minute limit killed one already, and the fix is `Start-Process` with
its output redirected to a log, not a shorter crawl. Report what it found when it
returns; do not wait on it.

Kept per **C4**. Do not follow these; they are here so the current rule can be
understood.

### R-05 · `VERSION` moves per user-visible capability
**2026-08-01 · ~~active~~ SUPERSEDED 2026-08-16 by [R-06](#r-06--version-moves-with-every-merged-pull-request)**

The rule was: raise `scrapex/version.py:VERSION` for each capability a person
would notice the absence of.

**What changed:** it left the judgement to whoever was writing, and they kept
deciding no. The number stood still for 48 commits — Phase A entire, T1 and B2 —
while the ledger's gate stayed green either way. The owner noticed and replaced
the rule with a mechanical one that needs no judgement.

**Still live from the old ruling:** the capability ledger itself, the derived
`MINIMUM_EXTENSION_VERSION`, and the generated `CHANGELOG.md`. Only the *trigger*
changed.

### R-38 · `R-19`'s five groups are a TAXONOMY plus a link table, not five datasets — shape D

**2026-08-21 · data model · refines [R-19](#r-19--the-five-multi-valued-contractor-groups-go-in-child-tables-not-json), and overrules the study's own recommendation**

> «شكل تخزين مجموعات R-19 الخمس … أيّها؟» → **«D — تصنيف خالص + جدول ربط مخصَّص»**

`R-19` ruled child tables over JSON and every measurement upheld it. What it did not
settle was *how* — [the study](R19-CHILD-TABLES-MEASURED.md) put five shapes side by side
and recommended **F**, a child dataset per group inside `generic_record` whose value
references `classification_node`. **He chose D**: the taxonomy plus a bespoke link table.

**He is right, and the recommendation was wrong for a reason worth writing down.** F's
headline argument was that it reuses machinery the warehouse already contains. Measured
on the live warehouse the same day:

| the machinery F would be the first tenant of | rows |
|---|---|
| `classification_node` | **0** |
| `classification_scheme` | **0** |
| `dataset_relationship` | **0** |
| `relationship_field_pair` | **0** |

**Existing machinery that has never carried a row is not an asset.** This one session
proved that three times: `is_enabled` called itself *"the gate navigation must call"* and
had zero callers; `record_absences` had zero callers; and the slice scope was *"built,
tested, and never used"* and turned out to be **wrong** — 17 cards paired against 34
URLs. The recommendation weighed whether the machinery EXISTED. What matters is whether
it RUNS.

**And F pays a full record's overhead for a two-integer join row.** Measured per row of
`generic_record`: `data_json` averages **1,049 bytes**, `record_key` is a 64-character
SHA-256, `content_hash` another 64, plus two timestamps, a status and four foreign keys.
A membership fact — *this contractor holds this node* — is two integers. At the study's
~500K rows that is the measured 4.7×, and it is conservative.

**"It inherits the lifecycle" was not true either:**

    retention.py     16 references to price_observation, 0 to generic_record
    compaction.py     7 references to price_observation, 0 to generic_record

The contractor dataset has no retention today. F would have added five more datasets to
that same gap rather than inheriting a solution.

**A fourth reason, which crosses [R-40](#r-40--dec-10-is-built-before-the-profile-crawl-not-after-it):**
F routes five groups through `approve_candidate`, the function that answers
`recovered=True` and writes nothing. D writes directly, so idempotency is one constraint
— `UNIQUE (contractor, node)` — correct by construction instead of by later repair.

**WHAT D MUST NOT LOSE, and it is one line.** F's one surviving advantage was that
`generic_record.source_snapshot_id NOT NULL` makes provenance **enforced by the schema**
rather than remembered. The link table carries the same column under the same constraint.
Then D is 4.7× smaller *and* provenance is still enforced.

**What D genuinely costs:** bespoke work in the export, the API, the panel and the CLI,
because a link table is not a dataset and nothing reads it for free. Noted rather than
discounted — and `O-2`, whether the contractor entity belongs in the mbiX workbook at
all, is parked by him, so the export half of that cost is not owed yet.

### R-39 · muqawil is registered `listing_plus_slice`, and one city is crawled before eleven hours are spent

**2026-08-21 · crawl scope · answers the registration `PLATFORM-PLAN` Decision 23 left to him**

> «نطاق زحف مقاول مسجَّل listing_only … ماذا أُسجِّل؟» → **«listing_plus_slice لمدينة واحدة أوّلاً»**

The profile pages carry the ~28 columns the listing does not, and the full crawl is
**34,834 pages — 11.1 hours**, measured over 87 minutes of real six-worker crawling at
52.5 pages a minute. He chose to see one city first.

**The city is read off the listing card, so a slice costs nothing to select.** Measured
from the live warehouse, the cities that a first slice could be:

| city | contractors | profile pages | at 1.14 s a page |
|---|---|---|---|
| RIYADH | 5,406 | 10,812 | ~3.4 h |
| JEDDAH | 2,206 | 4,412 | ~1.4 h |
| DAMMAM | 739 | 1,478 | ~28 min |
| AL MADINAH AL MUNAWWARAH | 499 | 998 | ~19 min |
| TABUK | 191 | 382 | ~7 min |

**A DEFECT THIS RULING EXPOSED BEFORE IT WAS IMPLEMENTED.** A slice is named in the
language of the page — `MuqawilPageSource.belongs_to_slice` says so — and measured
against the committed fixtures:

    en page, slice 'RIYADH'  → 3 of 4 cards match
    en page, slice 'الرياض'  → 0 of 4
    ar page, slice 'RIYADH'  → 0 of 4
    ar page, slice 'الرياض'  → 3 of 4

So a single `crawl_slice` value matches **one locale's pages only**. The frontier still
comes out correct, because `detail_rows` yields both locales' profile URLs for a matched
row — but every Arabic listing row is counted as *outside the slice*, which makes the
report a lie, and the whole slice would depend on the English pages happening to be on
disk. The frontier scan is therefore restricted to the locale the slice is named in, and
the report says which.

### R-40 · DEC-10 is built BEFORE the profile crawl, not after it

**2026-08-21 · idempotency · closes [DEC-10](BACKLOG.md) as a decision**

> «هل نبنيه قبل زحفة الملفّات؟» → **«نعم، قبل الزحفة»**

`approve_candidate`'s idempotency key is `(snapshot, locator)` plus the schema hash, so a
**corrected** parser re-run over stored pages returns `recovered=True` and changes not one
row. On the listing that was survivable — the pages are cheap to re-read. On 34,834
profile pages it is not: a parser defect found after the crawl costs **11 hours of
re-fetching** to fix what should be minutes of re-parsing.

**That is a direct contradiction of why the seam exists.**
`docs/GENERIC-FETCH-SEAM.md` separates fetching from interpreting precisely so that a
wrong parse costs minutes; an idempotency key that refuses to rewrite a corrected row
hands the cost straight back.

**It is also the one open item that changes the COST of the remaining work rather than
its scope**, which is why building it first is not sequencing preference. `R-38`'s link
table depends on it twice over: the five groups are parsed from the same profile pages,
and a first parse of a five-level taxonomy is unlikely to be the last.

The route already proven on live data — wipe and re-approve from disk, which took
`generic_record` from 1,172 to 13,892 with zero network on 2026-08-21 — stays available.
It works and it destroys history every time, which is what a row-aware key replaces.

### R-41 · A multi-valued group is named by a DECLARED per-site map, never by position or by its heading

**2026-08-21 · extraction · answers a question the measurement raised**

> «كيف تُسمّى المجموعات الخمس؟» → **«خريطة مُعلَنة لكل موقع»**

`R-38` needs to know which group a row belongs to, and neither obvious answer works.
Measured against the committed profile:

| candidate rule | why it fails |
|---|---|
| the detector's own name | it returns `Table 1` … `Table 5` — position, which moves when a section does |
| the nearest heading | **three of the five tables sit under one heading** |
| the column signature | two tables carry the same `الإسم / القيمة` pair, and three are **empty** for this contractor, so there are no columns to read |

So each site declares it, the way `CARD_FIELDS` and `PROFILE_FIELD_ORDER` already declare
what a listing and a profile publish. Explicit, tested against a committed fixture, and
unchanged when the site moves a section.

**And the heading rule fails for a second reason that would have been worse.** The
interests card is titled `Interests` in English and **`الأنشطة`** — "Activities" — in
Arabic. Not a translation. A heading-based rule read 25 nodes from the English profile and
**0 from the Arabic**, which is `DSN-05`'s failure again: a locale-dependent selector that
silently produces nothing for half the data.

**The price, stated:** one declaration per group per site. That is the cost of a rule that
cannot drift, and this file already records what the alternative costs.

### R-35 · The engine's version moves on a CONTRACT change; the extension's on a USER-VISIBLE one

**2026-08-21 · release · settles the trigger R-05 lost and R-07 left open**

> «كل تطويرتنا كانت تخص extension ام engine انا لا اعلم الان لان مشكل version غير
> محلولة · فكل منهم لهم version وهم لا يتحركوا طبقا للقاعدة اجعلها ديناميكية 100%»
> · «الثالث للمحرّك والثانى للإضافة، نفذ»

**He could not answer a basic question about his own project**, and that is the
defect: had the last two weeks' work gone into the engine or the extension? Measured
2026-08-21, over the 91 commits since `VERSION` last moved (`adf31b2`, 2026-08-10):

| | |
|---|---|
| touched `extension/` | **36** |
| touched `scrapex/` or `db/` | **42** |
| touched **both** | **12** |
| today's work alone | 9 commits, **0** touching `extension/` |

**One number asked about two products answers neither.** `scrapex/version.py` reads
`0.2.2` and `extension/manifest.json` reads `0.2.2` — equal **by history, not by
rule**: [R-07](#r-07--the-engine-keeps-the-version-gate-and-drops-the-advert)
unwelded them deliberately and `tests/test_version.py:536` fails if anyone re-pins
them. So their agreement today is a coincidence, which is precisely why the question
had no answer.

**A GATE ALREADY EXISTED AND WATCHED THE WRONG THING.** `tests/test_version.py` fails
when the *capability set* changes without `VERSION` moving. Capabilities had not
changed in 91 commits, so it stayed quiet while **three engine migrations landed in a
single day** — each one a change an older build cannot read.

### The two criteria, and why not one rule for both

    engine     a CONTRACT change: schema, protocol, or endpoint
    extension  a USER-VISIBLE change

A contract break stops **another program** working, which is what an engine consumer
needs warned about. Chrome shows the extension's number **to people**, so it should
move when what those people can *do* changes. One rule for both would either
announce releases the extension's users cannot see, or leave an engine consumer with
no signal that the schema moved.

**"USER-VISIBLE" IS NOT INVENTED HERE.** It is read off `version.Surface`, the
distinction `R-07` already relies on: a capability the **panel** executes raises the
minimum extension version, one the engine executes alone does not. Seven of the eight
capabilities are panel-executed.

### What "100% dynamic" was taken to mean, and what it was not

**Not** a number that moves with every commit — that is a commit counter, it is what
`R-05` was superseded for being, and it would break
`MINIMUM_EXTENSION_VERSION`, which `R-07` keeps as a **gate**: a gate that moves every
commit refuses everything.

**Instead: the criterion is enforced, so the number cannot fall 91 commits behind
again.** `scrapex/contractstamp.py` fingerprints the three parts and
`contracts/contract-baseline.json` records them against the version they describe. A
contract change with `VERSION` unmoved **fails the build**, naming the part:

```
the engine contract changed while VERSION stayed at 0.2.2:
  "schema": { "added": ["0008_a_page_remembers_how_to_ask_whether_it_changed.sql"] }
```

**The fingerprint is a sorted list and not a digest**, so the failure can say *which*
part moved. A digest can only say that something did, which is the report that sends
the next session reading three subsystems to find out.

**AND A REFACTOR IS EXPLICITLY NOT A CONTRACT CHANGE.** Moving code between files,
adding tests, writing documents — none of it changes anything another program can
observe, and a guard asserts the fingerprint cannot grow a part that a refactor moves.

**Proven by being made to fail**: the baseline was rolled back one migration and the
gate fired with the migration named. Twelve guards, and `tests/test_version.py`'s
forty-four still pass beside them.

**What this does not do:** it does not bump anything for him. The human part stays two
numbers and one command — `scrapex export-version` — which is what he measured it at.
What changed is that forgetting it is now a red build rather than a silent drift.

### R-34 · An account is the signed-in address, and a warehouse records whose it is

**2026-08-21 · architecture · answers [Q-14](BACKLOG.md), unblocks [REQ-26](REQUESTS.md)**

> «ايضا databse الموجودة حاليا اجعلها تخص حساب muhammad.bayoumi.ali@gmail.com»

`Q-14` asked what identifies an account, and it was put to him **without a
recommendation** because the Google address and the Chrome profile each fail exactly
one half of what he had described, and the answer decides where other people's data
lands. He settled it by naming one: **the signed-in address**, option (a).

**HIS OWN WAREHOUSE IS NOW CLAIMED BY IT** — `scrapex_meta.account_owner` reads
`muhammad.bayoumi.ali@gmail.com`.

| | |
|---|---|
| `scrapex_meta`, not a new table | it already holds exactly this kind of fact — `database_kind`, `migration_stream`, `contract_version`. One row, one truth about the file, **no migration** |
| the address is stored as he writes it | surrounding space is trimmed, and the **local part keeps its case**: email local parts are case-sensitive by specification, and folding them would quietly merge two addresses a provider considers different |
| re-claiming takes `force` | handing a warehouse from one account to another moves someone's data under another's name. `R-24`'s reasoning about a user's database, applied to its owner: deliberately, never behind his back |
| an unclaimed warehouse passes any account | every file that predates this is unclaimed, and none may stop working because a rule arrived after it (`R-23`) |

**WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT ENFORCED YET, and saying so is the point.**
`assert_owner` exists and **nothing calls it on the connect path**. `DATABASE_ROOT`
is still `~/.scrapex` — one directory per operating-system user — so a second account
on this machine has nowhere else to go, and refusing a warehouse claimed by someone
else *before* the per-account layout exists would lock him out of the only warehouse
there is. The rule has one definition ready for `REQ-26`; the layout is `REQ-26`.

**So this ruling answers the identity question and leaves the layout open** — the
half that was blocked on him is unblocked, and the half that is engineering is named.

### R-33 · The migration ledger is keyed on the migration's NAME, not its number

**2026-08-21 · data · answers [OP-30](BACKLOG.md), chosen from three options**

> «نفذ أ»

Found on his LIVE warehouse while upgrading it at his instruction, and it left the
file unopenable by any build — on `connect()` as well as on upgrade.
`database_migration` is `migration_number INTEGER PRIMARY KEY` — **one number
space** — and a warehouse carried over from the price database holds two streams
in it:

| number | name | whose |
|---|---|---|
| 6 | `0006_a_row_says_when_it_was_last_proved_absent.sql` | the engine's |
| 1006 | `0006_change_event.sql` | the price stream's, renumbered by the repair |

Engine migration `0006` was **the first number this stream had ever wanted**, so the
digests of two unrelated files were compared and it reported *"checksum changed;
restore the original migration file and retry"* — **with no file having changed.**

**THE NUMBER WAS ALREADY MEANINGLESS AND THE NAME NEVER WAS.** `migration_number`
claimed to say where in its stream a migration sits; with two streams sharing the
space it says only which row came first, and who holds a number is a question of
precedence rather than identity. A file's name is its identity, unique across both
streams, so a foreign row becomes invisible instead of fatal.

**WHAT `user_version` ALREADY GUARANTEED** is why this is safe: the ledger does not
decide what to apply — `PRAGMA user_version` does. It is purely a checksum record.

**WHAT THE FIX WAS NOT ALLOWED TO COST.** Two guards hold the line: a file whose
digest really differs is still refused, and a ledger missing a row for one of *our
own* migrations is still reported. Otherwise the fix would have turned a detectable
state into a silent one.

**AND WHY NOTHING CAUGHT IT, which is the part worth keeping.** A fresh `init-db`
writes only this stream's rows, so nothing collides — and **CI always starts from a
fresh database.** 273 tracked test files and the `migration-authority` job, which
runs the whole suite against the real migration stream, all passed while this sat
there. The collision needs a warehouse that **carried over**, and no fixture had
one. Same class of gap as [R-24](#r-24--a-users-database-is-upgraded-never-replaced):
the upgrade path is exercised only by a real user's file. There is a test that owns
it now.

**A `stream` column keyed `(stream, number)` is the model this deserves** and stays
in `OP-30` as the real fix: it is a migration, and it would have to run *before* the
verification that was failing.

### R-32 · ScrapeX is a collection platform. Price is ONE category, and filing it as the whole thing was a mistake

**2026-08-21 · architecture · corrects `pyproject.toml`, `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md`**

> «الاداة فى المقام الاول scrape او crawl · تسميتها او ادراجها تحت بند واحد الا وهو
> متابعة الاسعار دا خطا تماما» · «ونعمل category للمصادر لدينا الان 2 منتجات ومقاولين»

The tool is **collection first**. Price tracking was the first category, not the
category. His categories, in his words: **`products`** and **`contractors`** today,
with `jobs` and `tenders` named as coming.

**`products`, NOT `prices`, and the distinction is load-bearing.** A price is an
attribute of a product observed at a time. Naming the category "prices" would repeat
this very mistake one level down.

**THIS IS NOT A RENAME, AND THE MEASUREMENTS ARE WHY.** The framing is built in, and
it shows up as missing function:

| where | what the framing did |
|---|---|
| `retention.py`, `compaction.py` | measured: they touch **`price_observation` only**. The contractor dataset — 16,761 sighted ids — has no retention policy and no compaction, because nothing generic was ever written |
| two source registries | `source_site` holds 4 price sources, `site_profile` holds `muqawil_org`, and **muqawil is not in `sources.yaml` at all** — so a source lands in one or the other by accident of pipeline |
| `ConnectorFamily` | every value is a shop or price shape (`shopify-json`, `salla-html`, `heidelberg-price-matrix`). A directory, a tender board or a job board cannot be named in it |
| `pyproject.toml` | *"into a SQLite **price-tracking** warehouse"*, repeated in `CLAUDE.md` and `README.md` |

**WHY THE DESCRIPTION MATTERS MORE HERE THAN IT WOULD ELSEWHERE.** `CLAUDE.md` exists
because the repository is the only memory between two machines. A session that reads
*"price-tracking warehouse"* builds one. This framing is self-perpetuating in a way a
wrong comment is not — which is why correcting it is first in the plan and not last.

**What this settles, and what it does not.** Settled: price is a category, a source
names its category, and the platform's own documents say so. **Not** settled: whether
`source_site` and `site_profile` merge, whether `ConnectorFamily` grows or splits, and
what identifies an account (`Q-14`). Those are
[the plan](plans/2026-08-21-the-platform-not-a-price-tracker.md), and none of it is
built.
### R-31 · The warehouse records WHICH field changed, and a new field is a version, not a refusal

**2026-08-21 · data model · extends [R-30](#r-30--r-19-is-built-as-child-datasets-whose-value-references-a-taxonomy)**

> «اريد الافضل على الاطلاق ليس الاسهل فى التنفيذ فى المرحلة الحالية» · «نعم وسع النطاق ونفذ الأفضل»

He asked four things of `R-30`'s shape: is it dynamic when most contractors leave
most values empty, what happens when the site adds a field, is everything kept in
the database, and can a change be **written down** as "this field was updated"
rather than worked out afterwards. Measured, two were already true and **two were
not**, and the two that were not are independent of the (b)/(c) choice entirely.

**1 · A NEW FIELD IS REFUSED TODAY, NOT VERSIONED.**
`extract/service.py` raises `ExtractionConflict` when the field set differs from the
approved one, and its own message points at *"schema-drift review support"* that does
not exist. The machinery is all there — `version_number`, `status`, `valid_to` — and
**v2 is unreachable**: reaching it requires `valid_to` to be set, and measured, all
five references to `valid_to` in the code are **reads**. Nothing has ever written it.

**The rule is DIRECTIONAL, and that is what makes it safe.** A superset — every
approved field still present, new ones added — retires the active version and opens
v2. A subset, a rename or a retype is still **refused**. That distinction is not
invented for this ruling: it is exactly what happened in #234, where `region_id=0`'s
pages carried 21 of the declared 22 fields and were correctly refused. Auto-versioning
any drift would have accepted a parser that silently lost a column.

**2 · A REVISION RECORDS THE WHOLE ROW, SO "WHICH FIELD CHANGED" IS DERIVED.**
`generic_record_revision.data_json` holds the entire object. The answer to "when did
this contractor's readiness change" is computable by diffing two revisions and is
**written down nowhere**. So a field-level change log is added: the row, the field,
the value before, the value after, when, and the snapshot that proves it.

**IT IS LIGHTER THAN WHAT IT SUPPLEMENTS, WHICH IS THE PART WORTH KNOWING.** A
revision copies all 21 fields — roughly 2.5 KB — to record one field moving. A
field-change row is on the order of 100 bytes. **It does not replace the revision**:
the revision is the row as it stood, which is the thing an audit needs; the log is
the question anyone actually asks.

**3 · SPARSENESS WAS ALREADY TRUE, AND IS NOT A REASON TO PREFER (b).**
A child row exists per value held, so a contractor with no activities costs zero rows
and zero NULLs. That is true of (c) equally. Recorded because he asked, and because
the honest answer is that it does not distinguish the options.

**4 · EVERYTHING IS ALREADY IN THE DATABASE.** `data_json` plus the compressed page
in `generic_page_snapshot`, linked by `source_snapshot_id NOT NULL`. Nothing is
discarded. **But JSON's flexibility is partly an illusion and he should know it:** an
undeclared key is stored and is **invisible to the user**, because the payload's
columns come from the declared fields in `schema_version_field`. Flexibility in
storage is not flexibility in the product; that is what point 1 is for.

**What this costs.** `OP-25` route (c) — which he passed over on timing — is now in
scope, and there is one new table. He was told both before ruling.

### R-30 · R-19 is built as child DATASETS whose value references a taxonomy

> **EXTENDED, NOT REPLACED, by [R-31](#r-31--the-warehouse-records-which-field-changed-and-a-new-field-is-a-version-not-a-refusal) on 2026-08-21.** Everything below stands. He then asked whether (b) is dynamic for sparse and future fields, and whether a field change can be recorded rather than derived — and two of those answers were no. He widened the scope: «نعم وسع النطاق ونفذ الأفضل».

**2026-08-21 · data model · answers [Q-13](BACKLOG.md), refines [R-19](#r-19--the-five-multi-valued-contractor-groups-go-in-child-tables-not-json)**

> «نفذ ب» — option (b), chosen after asking for the three to be compared on time

He asked for his own ruling to be tested ([REQ-23](REQUESTS.md)), then for the three
implementations to be compared **on time specifically**, and chose (b). So `R-19`
stands and its implementation is settled:

| | |
|---|---|
| **where the child rows live** | a child **dataset** in `generic_record` — no new table, no migration for the rows themselves |
| **how the value is stored** | a reference to a `classification_node`, so the ~120-character bilingual path is stored **once** and referenced by integer |
| **how it is queried** | a **partial expression index** on `json_extract(data_json,'$.node_id')`, scoped by `dataset_definition_id` |
| **how it reaches the sheet** | one export tab per child dataset, driven by `dataset_relationship` |

**Why (b) and not (c), in his own terms — time.** (c) is 7x faster to load once
(3.9 s against 27.6 s) and (b) is **40x faster on the question that gets asked**
(0.6 ms against 20.2 ms) and **3.8x** on the per-value counts. The load happens once
per full re-extraction; the question happens whenever anyone asks it.

**And (a) — `R-19` read literally — is fastest at nothing measured fairly.** Its one
apparent win, the parent roll-up at 612 ms against 1,320 ms, is not the same query:
it matches a string **prefix** with `LIKE`, and the fixture's own separators are
inconsistent (`-` and `–` both appear), so that match fails silently on some values.
It also rewrites **103,698 rows in 5.9 s** when the site relabels a category, against
one row in 0.1 ms.

**Nothing writes `classification_node` today** — measured, `grep` finds no
`INSERT INTO classification` anywhere in the repository, and `reports.py` only names
the table in a glossary. The taxonomy writer is therefore the first thing (b) needs,
not a detail of it.

`region_id=0`'s 74 pages taught a 21-field schema, so every page declaring the
declared 22 is refused. The `contractors` dataset is **wiped and re-approved from the
stored snapshots**, which costs ~20 minutes and **not one network request** — the
snapshots are on disk, and that is the entire economics of
[GENERIC-FETCH-SEAM.md](GENERIC-FETCH-SEAM.md).

**It destroys 1,172 rows, and that is the reason it is cheap rather than a cost.**
Those rows are rebuilt from the same disk immediately, and the alternative kept them
at the price of two datasets describing one directory — which `R-11` would not accept.

**What this unblocks is the whole point.** The ledger holds **15,782 distinct ids of
the listing's 17,414** and the warehouse holds 1,172 records. The gap is not missing
evidence, it is unapproved evidence.

The third option — building schema-drift review, which the error message itself points
at — was **not rejected on merit**: it is the largest, it would serve every future
source, and it is now the only remaining part of `OP-25`. It was not chosen because it
would keep this crawl unextracted while it was built.

### R-29 · A contractor the site stops showing is `unavailable`, not `retired`

**2026-08-21 · data model · answers [OP-26](BACKLOG.md), completes [R-27](#r-27--a-row-never-disappears-from-the-users-view-its-state-becomes-a-column)**

> «unavailable» — chosen over `retired` and over a rule combining both

`generic_record.status` has accepted `active`, `unavailable` and `retired` since the
table existed, and **nothing has ever written either of the last two**. Detection was
built with `sightings.departures`; this ruling is what lets it write.

**`unavailable` means "the site is not showing this contractor right now" — and the
reversibility is the whole reason.** A crawl that ended early, a cell that failed to
size, a filter the site changed: any of those makes a standing contractor look absent.
Under `retired` that row becomes history with no way back. Under `unavailable` it
returns on the next crawl that sees it, which is exactly what the `returned` state and
`last_absent_at` — shipped in #235 — were built to express.

**`retired` is not thereby unusable.** It remains the honest answer for a contractor the
site states is gone rather than merely stops listing. Nothing writes it yet, and
nothing should until the site gives us that statement to read.

### R-27 · A row never disappears from the user's view; its state becomes a column

**2026-08-21 · data model and UI, and it answers a question I had put to him**

> «يجب ان يظل الصف ظاهر للمستخدم مهما اختلف حالة الرصد بينما يكون واضح فى عمود اخر
> مرة تم رؤيته اول مرة تم رؤيته هل اختفى فى اخر زحفة هل ظهر صف جديد لكنه يظل ظاهر
> للمستخدم»

**A contractor's row stays on screen whatever the crawl did or did not see.** What
changes is not its visibility but four facts, each of which is a COLUMN:

| | |
|---|---|
| **first seen** | when this contractor first appeared |
| **last seen** | when a crawl last showed us this contractor |
| **disappeared in the last crawl?** | the site has stopped showing it |
| **is this row new?** | it appeared in the most recent crawl |

**AND IT SETTLES A QUESTION I HAD RAISED.** I had asked him to choose between
`unavailable` and `retired` for a delisted contractor — the two values
`generic_record.status` offers. Under this ruling the choice matters far less, because
**status is informational and never a filter**: whichever value a departed row
carries, the row is still there and the column says what happened. A schema that can
express "gone" must not be wired to a reader that means "hidden".

**MEASURED THE SAME DAY, and the answer was no.** Two readers disagree, and the one
behind the user's grid is the wrong one:

- `browse_records` already returns `status`, `first_seen_at` and `last_seen_at` and
  filters on none of them. Correct by this ruling.
- `dataset_table_payload` — what the grid actually renders — filters
  **`AND status = 'active'`** on both the count and the rows, and builds each row from
  `data_json` alone, so all three facts are dropped. **A row that ever stopped being
  `active` would simply vanish from his screen**, which is what he is ruling out, and
  the two "did it change" columns exist nowhere at all.

**How to apply.**

- **Never filter a reader on `status`** to decide visibility. A caller that wants only
  the present rows filters explicitly and says so on screen.
- **Carry the record's own metadata into the payload**, beside the schema's fields.
  It is not part of the approved schema and must **not** be merged into `data_json`: a
  fact about our OBSERVATION is not a fact the site published, and this project does
  not edit source truth.
- **"New" and "disappeared" are DERIVED, not stored.** Both are a comparison against
  the most recent crawl, so they are computed for display rather than written into the
  row, where they would be stale the moment the next crawl ran.
